Four different implementations of gravitational n-body simulation. In order of worst to best performance:
- Sequential (brute-force)
- Parallelized (brute-force)
- Sequential Barnes-Hut (approximation)
- Parallelized Barnes-Hut (approximation)

More galaxy datasets can be found in the original location:

This was done during my time at KTH, so it's in dire need of refactoring.
